# Linear_Barcodes_Verification
Together with Filippo Samor√¨ and Matteo Bonucci, we developed this project as part of the final examination for the Computer Vision course in the Automation Engineering program at the University of Bologna.

Our project focuses on designing an algorithm to detect barcodes in gray-level images from a specific dataset. The algorithm identifies the Region of Interest (ROI) and computes various quality parameters, which are then recorded in an Excel table.
